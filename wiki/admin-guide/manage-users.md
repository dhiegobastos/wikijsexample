**Fill in** the fields and click **Create User**.

# Authorize a social user
A social user is authenticated using Microsoft, Google or Facebook login mechanisms. It provides convenience for users by not having to remember yet another login.

To authorize a social user to login to Wiki.js, click on the **Create / Authorize User** button in the top right corner of the **Users** page.

**Fill in** the email address of the user and select the social provider in the **Provider** dropdown menu.

Finally, click the **Authorize User** button.

# Edit a user
To edit information about a user, click on its name from the **Users** page list.

Note that the email address cannot be modified as this is the unique identifier of the user. If the email address of a user changed, you must create a new account and delete the old one if necessary.

Read the [Manage Access Rights](/wiki/admin-guide/manage-access-rights) page to learn how to provide the necessary access rights to a user.

# Delete a user
To delete (or de-authorize) a user, click on its name from the **Users** page list.

Click on the red **Delete Account** button at the bottom right of the page.
